# The Open DevOps Pipeline Specification

The Open DevOps Pipeline Specification was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how DevOps Pipeline are described. The Open DevOps Pipeline Specification is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format of DevOps Pipeline Definition.

The goal of The Open DevOps Pipeline Specification is to define a standard, tools-agnostic definition to DevOps Pipeline which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the DevOps Pipeline without access to automation script, documentation, or through tools configuration inspection. When properly defined via Open DevOps Pipeline Specification, a consumer can understand and run with the DevOps Pipeline with a minimal amount of configuration efforts.
